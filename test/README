test

These files provide test functions for checking out the SimController Hardware.

ain_mon.c:	Test AIN Controls
	Runs a 1 sec. loop that displays the readings of the AIN channels
	The test also provides the readings of all AIN signals in this order:
		AIN0, AIN1, AIN2, AIN3, AIN4, AIN5
		Breath Sense, Touch Sense 1, Pressure Sense (unused), Touch Sense 2, Touch Sense 3, Touch Sense 4

ain_air_test.c:		Test AIN and Lung Control
	Runs a 250 ms. loop that cycles the Lung Pump, Rise and Fall controls in sequence.
	(Note that while a Tank control exists, it is not used in the system).
	Output order same as ain_mon

tsunami_test.cpp:
	At start, displays the startup data from the tsunami. Then accepts commands to
	play sound file number 001 on the Tsunami to a specified channel.
	
	Start with su and indicate the tty port (tty2 is usually the correct one).
	
	Example: su tsinami_test ttyO2
	
	Enter a number followed by ENTER key to play each channel:
	1	Left Dorsal	(This one plays on the headset due to a bug in the code right now, but fixed on next update)
	2	Right Dorsal
	3	Left Femoral
	4	Right Femoral
	5	Speaker 1
	6	Speaker 2
	7	Headset
	q	Exit program
